- **Event Exploration**: Browse through a wide range of events. Choose what you need & make unforgettable memories.

- **AOS Library**: The website uses AOS (Animate On Scroll) library to add some animations and transitions to the elements on the page. The website also uses some custom data attributes to control the animation effects.

- **Context API**: The project uses React’s Context API for state management. This is in the useContext hook that’s used to access the AuthContext

- **Private Routing**: The PrivateRoute component restricts access to certain routes based on authentication status. If a user is not authenticated, they are redirected to the login page.

- **Firebase for authentication and database** Used Firebase authentication to authenticate the user & also used Firebase hosting to host the site.


- **Google login** The project includes a Google login button that allows users to register or log in using their Google account in a moment.
